## Paul (Yang) Xu's Code Portfolio

This repository documents some of my work doing different types of machine learning, statistical data analysis, and data visualization tasks. In this repository, you will find:

#### Non-MNIST Digit Regocnition

This is a most recent machine learning practice using the [Character Font Images dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images) from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) with the Python stack (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`)

#### Dynamic Social Network Analysis

I built a temporal social network with R, Tableau, and [Gephi](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Font+Images) with student and teacher behavioral data from an online reading platform called [Udio](http://cet.cast.org/research-overview/udio-literacy-intervention/). To see a video of the visualization of that network, please click [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnpdwZ_oJnE).

In this folder, you will find:

- R Script with which I cleaned the data
- The network file (Gephi)
- Papers written and conference posters

#### "Confetti Chart" Analysis

![confetti chart](Confetti_Chart/confetti.png)

Using the same data from [Udio](http://cet.cast.org/research-overview/udio-literacy-intervention/), I used Process Mining techniques ([Dotted Chart Analysis](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/process-mining/0/steps/15627)) to visualize in a given class, what the students did in the learning environment collectively throughout a semester. Because the chart looks like confetti dropping, I named it confetti chart analysis. To see a live Shiny dashboard based on `ggvis`, please [click here](https://paulxu.shinyapps.io/udio/). The folder contains the R code used to build the dashboard.

#### Statistical Data Analysis

This folder contains R code that I used for an actual research project, where I used various R packages to clean data before performing descriptive and inferential statistical analysis.
